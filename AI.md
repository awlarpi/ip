Github Copilot was used for autocomplete and code geenration.
The approach was to describe to the LLM what needs to be accomplished, and provide it with revelant context and examples.
Some observations is that the LLM seems to be already be trained on past CS2103T data. On one instance, it generated code that fit right into the CS2103T requirements even though I had yet to tell it about the requirements.
