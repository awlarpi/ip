Github Copilot was used for autocomplete and code geenration.
- The approach was to make use of autocomplete to speed up the process of writing code.
- It was extensively used for tedious tasks like writing test cases and javadocs.
- I consulted it when I faced bugs or errors.
- Some observations is that the LLM seems to be already be trained on past CS2103T data. On one instance, it generated code that fit right into the CS2103T requirements even though I had yet to tell it about the requirements.
